# r7-review-ladder findings — validation added in `f6e0613..b8c0036`

Scope: `git diff f6e0613 b8c0036 -- src/lgm/curve.py src/lgm/instruments.py src/lgm/ladder.py`.
Nothing under `src/`, `scripts/` or `tests/` was edited. Every number cited below is printed by the
named function in `docs/loop/r7_review_ladder_repro.py`:

Severity `hypothetical` means no current caller passes the input; the code path is still reachable
through the public API.

## Findings

| # | File:line | Cat | What happens | Reproducer | Suggested fix | Severity |
|---|-----------|-----|--------------|------------|---------------|----------|
| 1 | `src/lgm/instruments.py:108`, `:114` | c | A `TreasuryStrip` maturing exactly on `curve.date` returns `curve_price` 0.0 (expected `100*df(0)` = 100.0) and `dirty_price` 0.0 even when a quote of 99.0 is supplied (expected 99.0). Only the `<=` boundary is wrong; strictly past maturities correctly stop using stale quotes/past curve prices. | `finding_1_strip_at_curve_date` | Use `maturity < curve.date` so the maturity-date value is priced at `t = 0`. | hypothetical: no caller prices a strip on its maturity date, so the equality never occurs. |
| 2 | `src/lgm/instruments.py:156` | c | `TermFund.growth_factor` returns 0.0 at `t = 0` (expected `(1+y-e)^0` = 1.0). The guard treats "terminates today" as "expired"; the existing test only covers a strictly past termination and does not pin this boundary. | `finding_2_fund_growth_at_termination` | Guard `t < 0.0` instead of `t <= 0.0`. | hypothetical: `TermFund.cashflows` already returns `[]` when termination `<= settle`, so no caller reaches growth at t = 0. |
| 3 | `src/lgm/instruments.py:161-164` | b | `TermFund.cashflows` guards on `settle` but values the flow at `curve.date`; with `settle = curve.date - 30 days` and `termination == curve.date` it returns `[(2026-10-20, 0.0)]` instead of `[]`, so `build_matrix` accepts a zero-value fund with price 1.0. The guard's stated purpose ("no future cash flows") is defeated by a mismatched settle/curve pair. | `finding_3_fund_settle_vs_curve_date` | Guard on `curve.date` (the valuation date), or derive both from one date. | hypothetical: every caller passes `settle = curve.date`. |
| 4 | `src/lgm/ladder.py:243-254` | b | `premium` filters expired instruments but never checks that the first payment is still in the future. With a curve dated 2033-01-01 and `payment_schedule()` (first payment 2033-01-01, ten payments to 2042-01-01), all instrument flows are strictly after settlement, the LP is infeasible, and `premium` returns `nan` (cost `nan`) instead of raising. One year later the same call raises `ValueError` from `zero_coupon_cost`/`curve.df` ("discount maturity must contain finite nonnegative years"), so the failure mode changes type with the date. | `finding_4_premium_at_first_payment` | Require `payments[0][0] > curve.date` in `premium` (or `solve`) and raise `ValueError("first payment is due at settlement")`. | hypothetical now: `8075e26` dropped the 2033 fit from `scripts/ladder_premium.py` rather than fixing the library; no current caller passes such a curve. |

## Planner decisions

- Finding 1 (no change): at its maturity date the strip has no future cash flow (`cashflows()` returns `[]`), so a price of 0 is consistent with that.
- Finding 2 (no change): at its termination date the fund has no future cash flow (`cashflows()` returns `[]`), so a growth factor of 0 is consistent with that.

## Notes, not findings

- `zero_coupon_cost` now rejects payment schedules with duplicate dates or nonpositive amounts even though the function could in principle price an aggregated schedule; no caller passes one.
- `check_coverage`/`idle_cash_days` reject extra keys instead of ignoring them; no caller passes a superset.
- `TreasuryBond.mod_duration`'s "matured" message would also describe a zero clean quote; no quote in the data is zero.
